# Centipede
This solo class project was made in C++ utilizing the TEAL framework which extends the SFML API and is an attempt at the recreation of the classic arcade game "Centipede". 




The game is not a completely finished clone, however; it does boast many of the original features such as Attractor Mode, 1-Player Mode, Wave Management, etc. and can run a full game loop.
